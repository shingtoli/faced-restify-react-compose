# Face Detection over Web #
Faced on Restify & React with Docker-Compose

## Running the Docker Containers ##

1. Ensure that Docker is running

  ````shell
  cd faced-restify-react-compose
  docker-compose up -d
  ````

2. Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

  Note: use only `localhost` for the url as Browser Webcam requires a `https` connection otherwise.
